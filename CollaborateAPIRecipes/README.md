# Cool API Recipes or web apps using Collaborate

*I didn't really have time to add anything here, but hopefully somebody does at some point!

When uploading work, please add in the following structure:

> Folder (Recipe/app name)
  
  >> README.md (with instructions and list of each api call)
  
  >> Javascript or other file (if using actual script to string together the API calls)
  
  
  
## Example:

> CreatePublishSend

  >> README.md
  
  >> createPublishSend.js
