# CollaborateSyncQuote

This project allows you to automatically update a CPQ Quote record to "Primary" and "Accepted" if the page is accepted in a Collaborate document. This can also be generalized to other objects used with Collaborate's page-level acceptance and repeatable pages functionality. It uses Apex and Collaborate's REST API to do this.

**You'll also need to create a remote site for your Collaborate account site URL**

For example, adding "https://companyname.octiv.com"
