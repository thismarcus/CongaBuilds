# CollaborateVersionUponCreate

This project allows you to automatically create a new Version of a Collaborate document upon creating one from Salesforce. This allows you to do version comparison for any and all edits (since Version comparision requires 2 Version to compare between). It uses Apex and Collaborate's REST API to do this.

**You'll also need to create a remote site for your Collaborate account site URL***

For example, adding "https://companyname.octiv.com"
