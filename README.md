# Conga Builds

## A few disclaimers:

These are not officially supported solutions. These are some creative customizations to make builds quickers or build quick proof of concepts where scale and testing might not have been a priority. Anyone using these examples is fully responsible for testing, deploying, and maintaining them. These are not meant to be customer production-ready examples, and Conga will not support any troubleshooting of these advanced customizations.
